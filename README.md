# Personal Profile

A creative, analytical and quality driven individual with a passion for comprehensive systems and functionality. A graduate from the Makers Academy coding bootcamp, I am experienced in transforming client-like requests into fully functioning web-apps, ensuring that user friendliness is always utilised through a variety of front-end exposures. I have almost 10 years of experience working in payroll and, more recently compliance, where a high level of attention to detail and simplifying complex processes were integral to the roles. My passion for coding began whilst working with many often basic and clunky Excel spreadsheets on a daily basis. I found improving the functionality of these extremely satisfying and, subsequently, I developed a keen interest in creating hidden tabs to do the heavy lifting in the background (back-end type tabs) and user-friendly user interface tabs (front-end type tabs). This, alongside a natural love of learning in general, led to a passion in coding. I now possess a wide range of tech skills in the software development sector and I am now looking to fully integrate myself within the coding world.

# Education

**Makers Academy**: *September 2020 – December 2020*

- Gained the tech skills listed above through the creation of multiple web apps (see Coding Projects section below), whilst fulfilling my love for both general learning and learning languages (currently learning French).
- Experienced extensive teamwork principles, such as daily standups and agile methodology, both in team projects (three different team projects in five weeks) and in daily pair programming. All of these were especially present in the London Mock Exchange project (see below Coding Projects section) and discussed in the accompanying presentation (Presentation link). All projects at Makers were an opportunity to transpose my existing experience and skills of being a good communicator, and to further develop written and verbal communication skills in the context of a Software Development project.
- Learned to effectively debug by applying my existing skills in attention to detail, logical thinking, and methodical approaches (Own Debugging Process link).
- Utilised conventional coding principles such as Planning and Diagramming, Single Responsibility Principle, Encapsulation, Code Quality, TDD, Readability, as well as plentiful and well written commits. This is especially present in the Bank Account Project, and satisfies my drive to ensure quality results and quality functionality.
- Created multiple web apps using various languages, testing suites, and servers, as well as user input and database creation. These included a project using React (front-end) and Ruby on Rails (back-end), and a project using React (front-end) and Django (back-end). Languages subsequently used were Python, Ruby, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, as well as testing suites such as RSpec (Ruby) and Jasmine (JavaScript).


**Southampton Solent University**: *2006 - 2009*  

- Learned to record music in professional studios to a high sonic quality, utilising a range of high grade recording equipment as well as learning to master ProTools recording software. These results were achieved by creating/capturing quality at every level in the production process, from microphone recording and editing/general production to mixing and mastering. Quality results were additionally achieved by applying a high level of attention to detail, concentration, creativity and problem solving, as well as a methodical approach.

# Skills

**Problem Solving**
During my time at Makers, I developed a heightened level of my problem solving ability. Following a debugging process centred around resolving the smallest issue first, and ‘tightening the loop’, this ensured that most problems were resolvable. It also taught me that this general philosophy can be applied to non-coding related issues, such as problems within the scope of a team. I played an integral part in resolving issues as a team by utilising techniques such as breaking down the issue, splitting the team to work on different elements of the problem, as well as creating a process for each issue we encountered before reconvening.

**Communication/Training**
I have a good sense of tailoring explanations to people to suit their specific level, and am very aware of the fact that everyone has different levels of intelligence, processing speeds, and ways of understanding. I am subsequently known for my excellent training skills, both verbally and written, as well as my proactive approach to following up to determine whether the training provided requires any further questions to be answered. I have designed training programmes numerous times over my career, and as such, it has given me the aforementioned skills and improved my communication skills significantly.

**Attention to detail**
Great attention to detail has always been a strong skill of mine which I have gained in a number of different roles over the course of my career. Whether running the contractor payroll and ensuring that all incoming payments consistently matched all invoices or reviewing contractor freelancer documents in eleven different languages to ensure compliance, it was a fundamental part of my remit and strengthened this skill further to an excellent level. During the Makers course, I consistently found typos (especially when pairing) which cumulatively saved many hours of debugging time.
