# Background

I am a Makers alumnus, and am currently looking to acquire my first role in Junior Software Development. During my time as a Compliance Manager, I gained a wealth of office knowledge, including team management, auditing, experience with large database creation (excel), client and customer negotiation, the ability to diffuse issues and disagreements, and a passion for creating simplicity from complex systems and situations. I am naturally creative, composed, measured and consistent, all attributes that I feel would fit well into the development industry.

# Motivation

When given the opportunity to create interactive database spreadsheets during my previous career, I relished the opportunity to design these with a strong sense of user friendliness, complete with aesthetically pleasing ‘user interface’ tabs, whilst hidden tabs including the formulas for the interface tabs, performed the heavy lifting in the background. Looking back, I realise how similar these principles were to the world of coding. After several months, I decided to take the plunge and sign myself up for the Makers Academy course. Coding aligns with my love of learning languages, creativity, functionality, and order. All of which fuels my passion and confirms for me that coding is a great fit for my strengths and personality.

# Skills

**Problem Solving**
During my time at Makers, I developed a heightened level of my problem solving ability. Following a debugging process centred around resolving the smallest issue first, and ‘tightening the loop’, this ensured that most problems were resolvable. It also taught me that this general philosophy can be applied to non-coding related issues, such as problems within the scope of a team. I played an integral part in resolving issues as a team by utilising techniques such as breaking down the issue, splitting the team to work on different elements of the problem, as well as creating a process for each issue we encountered before reconvening.

**Communication/Training**
I have a good sense of tailoring explanations to people to suit their specific level, and am very aware of the fact that everyone has different levels of intelligence, processing speeds, and ways of understanding. I am subsequently known for my excellent training skills, both verbally and written, as well as my proactive approach to following up to determine whether the training provided requires any further questions to be answered. I have designed training programmes numerous times over my career, and as such, it has given me the aforementioned skills and improved my communication skills significantly.

**Attention to detail**
Great attention to detail has always been a strong skill of mine which I have gained in a number of different roles over the course of my career. Whether running the contractor payroll and ensuring that all incoming payments consistently matched all invoices or reviewing contractor freelancer documents in eleven different languages to ensure compliance, it was a fundamental part of my remit and strengthened this skill further to an excellent level. During the Makers course, I consistently found typos (especially when pairing) which cumulatively saved many hours of debugging time.
