# Personal Profile

A creative, analytical and quality driven individual with a passion for user friendly systems and functionality. An ex Compliance Manager who has taken the bold step in changing career to feed an ever growing passion for coding which began whilst in previous professional roles whilst working with Excel spreadsheets. This was due to the attention to detail required, the functionality provided, and although I didn't know that there was a link to coding at the time, an interest which included hidden tabs doing the heavy lifting in the background (backend type tabs), and user friendly user interface tabs (front end type tabs). My fondness for
functionality has been explored further at the Makers Academy coding bootcamp where I have consistently been tasked with transforming client-like requests into fully functioning web-apps, whilst at the same time ensuring that my keenness for user friendliness has been utilised through a variety of front-end exposures. It is this symbiotic dynamic that drives my passion for coding, along with an all-round love for learning.

# Skills

**Problem Solving**
During my time at Makers, I developed a heightened level of my problem solving ability. Following a debugging process centred around resolving the smallest issue first, and ‘tightening the loop’, this ensured that most problems were resolvable. It also taught me that this general philosophy can be applied to non-coding related issues, such as problems within the scope of a team. I played an integral part in resolving issues as a team by utilising techniques such as breaking down the issue, splitting the team to work on different elements of the problem, as well as creating a process for each issue we encountered before reconvening.

**Communication/Training**
I have a good sense of tailoring explanations to people to suit their specific level, and am very aware of the fact that everyone has different levels of intelligence, processing speeds, and ways of understanding. I am subsequently known for my excellent training skills, both verbally and written, as well as my proactive approach to following up to determine whether the training provided requires any further questions to be answered. I have designed training programmes numerous times over my career, and as such, it has given me the aforementioned skills and improved my communication skills significantly.

**Attention to detail**
Great attention to detail has always been a strong skill of mine which I have gained in a number of different roles over the course of my career. Whether running the contractor payroll and ensuring that all incoming payments consistently matched all invoices or reviewing contractor freelancer documents in eleven different languages to ensure compliance, it was a fundamental part of my remit and strengthened this skill further to an excellent level. During the Makers course, I consistently found typos (especially when pairing) which cumulatively saved many hours of debugging time.
